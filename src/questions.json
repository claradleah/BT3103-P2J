    "/*\n Welcome to From Python to JS. \n\n This quick and easy online module will teach you JavaScript, the popular programming language used for the Web. \n\n JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, along with HTML and CSS .\n*/",
